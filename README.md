I´m just serious studiyng Front-end for 2-3 months ago. Learning abou JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

That´s my real first project that I contructed with no help or watching videos, only apllication what I learned.

I´m open to tips. I´m realing loving it not only searching for the "Dream Job", so I want to grow up my abilities.
